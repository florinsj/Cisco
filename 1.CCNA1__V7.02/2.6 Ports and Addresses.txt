2.6.1. IP address

// every device in network need to have an IP address
// used for end-to-end communication and to locate a device in network

// 2 types of ip : IPv4 and IPv6

// IPv4 --> 32 bits
// IPv4 = 4 decimal numbers (0-255) separated by dot "." ; ex : 192.168.1.1
// 4 decimal number x 8bits/number =32bits
// IPv4 need an 32 bits mask to differentiate the network portion from host portion
// IPv4 coupled with mask determine to wich subnet the device is a member

// IPv6 --> 128bits
// 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal values, separated by colon ":"  ex ipv6:  2001:db8:acad:10::10
// 8 groups x 4 hexadecimals = 32 hexadecimal
// each hexadecimal = 4 bits
// 32 hexadecimal x 4 bits =128 total bits for IPv6
// not case sensitive

2.6.2 Interfaces and Ports

// switches have physical ports for device to connect.
// switches ports don't support IP address
// some switches have one ore more SVI (switch virtual interface). the ip is assigned to SVI
// SVI lets you remotely manage a switch
